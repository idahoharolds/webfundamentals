                <p class=" elves-p">If you've never heard of Elves Chasm, then you're in for a real treat. This amazing natural wonder is considered one of the Grand Canyon's best-kept secrets. This rock formation is the oldest in the Grand Canyon, dating to over 1.8 billion years ago. There's a plethora of diverse plant and wildlife. Elves Chasm is seriously one of the Colorado River's most beautiful spots. Accessing the chasm is an adventure in and of itself.</p>

            <h2 class="little-title">Little Collorado</h2>
            <p> Despite its name, the Little Colorado River is one of the largest tributaries of the Grand Canyon, forming a dramatic narrow gorge that stays deep and enclosed for 45 miles across the flat plains of the Painted Desert in the Navajo Indian Reservation, before becoming shallower as it approaches Cameron on US 89, so that when the highway crosses the river the cliffs are only 100 feet high and the canyon floor is wide and bushy. The cliffs recede completely a little way east, though the river extends a long distance further to its origin on the slopes of Mount Baldy near Springerville, on the way tumbling over a few cascades including 185 foot Grand Falls.
            </p>
            <p>The falls are visible for just three or four months each year, however, as the river flows only during spring and after summer monsoons; for the rest of the time the Little Colorado and its gorge are largely dry apart from the lowest 13 miles, downstream of Blue Spring. This powerful, year-round source produces large volumes of brilliant turquiose water, the unusual color being due to suspension of several minerals including calcium carbonate. The color is diluted, or masked entirely if the river is flowing from further upstream, after rainfall.</p>
