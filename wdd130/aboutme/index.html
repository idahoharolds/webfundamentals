    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Harold and I was born and raised in the pearl of the orient seas, Philippines.</p>
        
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 13 years. When I was 18, I served my Mission in Philippines Butuan Mission which truly is a blessing in my life. </p>

    <p>Now, I'm a working student who is currently working as a technical support and who aspires to become a web developer soon. I do love to read and make arts in my spare time.</p>
